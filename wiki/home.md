# HIC-AL

A Web Platform for HIC-AL community, serving the regional office's communication needs, and aimed at giving featured presence to HIC-AL Members' activities in Latin America.

The design of this platform attempts to combine global HIC network's editorial/informational specifications with a set of features designed with the dynamic of HIC-AL's regional Members in mind.

Microsites: Theme-specific Sections within the Platform called that allow some functional, editorial and aesthetic flexibility.
