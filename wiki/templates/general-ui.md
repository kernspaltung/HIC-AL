# General UI

This refers to those components which are always visible in the Platform, regardless of which Section or Content we find ourselves currently in.

The General UI is comprised of multiple Navigation Menus. Most of them have multiple hierarchical levels. The user will be able to enter a menu's Hierarchy and navigate the underlying elements up to any possible hierarchy level.
