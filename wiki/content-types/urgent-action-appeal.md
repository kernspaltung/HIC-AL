# Urgent Action Appeal

**Inherits: [Urgent Information Item](../blob/master/wiki/content-types/urgent-information-item.md)**

Letters or documents, properly documented, which detail and quantify a Violation and openly ask for Governments to respond.

In HIC-AL’s perspective, it is not so easy for them, or its members to create Urgent Action Appeals. HIC-AL and its members will most likely create [Alerts](../blob/master/wiki/content-types/alert.md), which depend only on confirmation by one of HIC-AL's members to be deemed trustworthy and, thus, publishable (HIC-AL members’ reports and alerts are oftentimes sent over WhatsApp or similar).

Taking an [Alert](../blob/master/wiki/content-types/alert.md) as a starting point, a proper Urgent Action Appeal and/or Violation record could be created.
